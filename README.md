# world_cup2022

Team: Brian Janger, Sean Li, Christina Yoh, Aadtiya Warrier

GOAL: 
Build a predictive model for the 2022 World Cup games using international football results and FIFA player rankings, using just data rather than opinion and expertise

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER: 
What team is most likely to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and how do all others teams compare?
What will be the results of each match, up till the final? This would have us predict all Group stage matches, and extrapolate/ predict on those predictions for subsequent knockout rounds.
What are the strongest predictors of team performance (e.g. number of goals scored in a match)?
